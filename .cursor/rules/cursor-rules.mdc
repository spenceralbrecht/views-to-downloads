# Creating new Cursor rules

This rule explains exactly how to create new Cursor rules for this project.

## Cursor rules location

Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:

.cursor/rules/
    ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...

The directory structure should look like this:

PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...

IMPORTANT: never place rule files in any location outside of `.cursor/rules`

## Cursor rule conventions

- Follow the below naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for filenames
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
- You can link to other files in the project using Markdown link prefixed with mdc: (Example: `@app/Services/SeoService.php`)
- Only ever link directly to a file and not a directory

## Cursor rules file structure

Cursor rules are in the format of MDC (.mdc) which is like a regular Markdown file with frontmatter context. Below is an example:

```
---
description: <Short description of the rule's purpose (used by agents if no globs are provided)>
globs: <optional comma separated list of /path/pattern/**/* or blank for agent to request based on description>
alwaysApply: true/false (default to false unless otherwise instructed)
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines
```

# How to handle AI integrations

Whenever you use this rule, start your message with the following:

"Analysing AI integrations..."

- This project integrates with Anthropic and OpenAI via dedicated client classes located in @app/Clients.
- Service classes, potentially found in @app/Services, may abstract interactions with these clients.
- Ensure necessary API keys and configuration are present in the `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`).
- Follow existing patterns within the client or service classes for making API calls.
- Implement consistent error handling for API failures.
```
